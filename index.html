    <h1>What is Script Farmer?</h1>
    <div class="three_paragraphs">
      <p class="body">
        Hi! My goal is to help people write their own useful code.

        Script Farmer is an Online journey to use artificial intelligence and Python code in Web
        applications to solve people's problems.

      <p class="body">
        Data science and the elements of artificial intelligence and machine
        learning are hard...or so we are told. But what if they weren't?<br> 
        </br>Script Farmer creates deliberate, modular, objects that allown anyone to
        harness data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.
        <br></br>I would like to help you transfer Python scripts from Juypter notebooks
        and into functional programs for problem solving and data science. I haven't found a simple
        method that helps control, share, and market python code to allow the
        benefits of custom software to be extended to non-software engineers.
        Subjects like REST APIs, Docker containers, IDEs, and even GUIs are not
        easy for a data scientist. But they should be! <br />
      </p>
      <h1> How does this work?</h1>
    <p>An introductory object ensures these tools would be useful for you. A chatbot would serve in this purpose. The chatbot could also display applicable objects to match the user's intent. </p>
    <p>All of the objects would be standardized to accept and output a common data format, so each could manipulate the data the other would produce.</p>
    <p>Finally, the modular objects would need to be compiled and stored in a container for the user.</p>

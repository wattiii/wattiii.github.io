  <p>
    Your data science script as an application. An Online journey to use artificial intelligence and Python code in Web
    applications to solve data science problems.</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p> Hi! My name is James Watt, and I am a father, husband, an emerging environmental advocate, regenerative gardener,
    avid chicken keeper, and a retired Soldier. My goal is to help people convert Python code into useful software.
    In my professional career, I'm an accomplished delivery lead with an accomplished 24-year record of outstanding
    results. It's important to me to continue serving others and contributing to the planet's welfare. </br></br>

    I would like to help turn your Python scripts out of Juypter notebooks and into functional programs for data
    science. I haven't found a method that helps control, share, and market python code to allow the benefits of custom
    software to be extended to non-software engineers. Subjects like REST APIs, Docker containers, IDEs, and even GUIs
    are not easy for a data scientist. But they should be!
  </p>
  <p> Sincerely,

    James
